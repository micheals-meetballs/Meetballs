Django backend project::

usefulpython -> backend admin tools
meetballs -> backend project
assets -> all media for backend (i don't think we need it but just incase?)


Suggested when working on backend:

1. Create a new branch for your work
2. Create a pip virtual environment [(INSTRUCTIONS)](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_using-the-create-environment-command)
3. Install the requirements.txt
4. Start coding.

Good luck :)
